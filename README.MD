  - Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
  - Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js.
  - MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing findables and user information.
  - Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

- Authentication:
  - JSON Web Tokens (JWT): For secure user authentication and authorization.

## Getting Started

To run the Findables.co project locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/chayan/findables.co.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies for both the front-end and back-end:

   ```
   cd findables.co/frontend
   npm install
   cd ../backend
   npm install 
   node server.js
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `/server` directory and define the following variables:
     - `MONGODB_URI`: Connection string for your MongoDB database.
     - `JWT_SECRET`: A secret key used for signing and verifying JSON Web Tokens.
     - `PORT`: Port number for the server to run (e.g., 5000).

4. Populate the MongoDB database with initial data if needed (e.g., predefined categories, sample findables).

5. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000` (assuming the front-end runs on port 3000).
